# Structure/Steps for timetable maker program

> User will enter name (eg. Rick Astley)
> User will enter *optional* information (eg.Purpose for making, year , name of the institute etc.)

> For ease and initial versions we will support 5 days of the week(Cause saturday sunday is for chillin' dude😎)

> User then will start entering **IMPORTANT** Information.
> User will enter all the subjects/lectures which the institute may have to teach in the respective 5 days.(for the initial release we will take maximum 6/7/8 subjects in total)

> Our program in its initial stage will have 8 lectures/classes in a day(will adjust later accordin to user input but not for now atleast)

> Then timetablemaker™ will randomly put those subjects in 40 slots

> Then will just print it out ! Hope this works 🤞🤞
